      <h1>About Me API</h1>
      
      <h2>About the API</h2>
      <p>I made and deployed a RESTful API using Flask in Python. I deployed the API to an Amazon AWS EC2 instance at <a href="http://www.williamsmolinskijr.com">http://www.williamsmolinskijr.com</a>. The API can be used to request my resume and 
    various other small programs I made.</p>
      
      <h2>How to Use the API</h2>
      <p>You can either navigate the api in the browser (to see the resume in the browser go to /api/resume) or create a program to send requests to the API. When making your own program or navigating in the browser, make requests or go to 
        <a href="http://www.williamsmolinskijr.com/api/options">http://www.williamsmolinskijr.com/api/options</a> to get a formatted String list of all the available programs and files you can request. Then 
        you can make a request to http://www.williamsmolinskijr.com/api/options/[fileName] where you replace [fileName] with the file you want to request and it will send the contents of the file back (or display them in the browser) 
        to you where you
        can then make a file to put the contents in or print them out to the console. 
      </p>

      <h2>Run the Program I Made</h2>
      <p>Alternatively to creating your own program, I made one that will handle sending requests based on user input into the console and will output the results of requested files to a file on the users system. The 
        requirements to run this programs are that you need Python installed with the requests library by running "pip install requests" once you have python installed. You can then use an IDE of your choice to run the program:
      </p>
      <pre><code>
import requests

def send_request(route):
    #The "Code" is there for a sort of authentication that I put into the API, it checks to make sure it matches with the code in the API and if it doesn't it will abort with error code 401.
    #It also prevents the contents from being displayed in the browser.
    return requests.get('http://www.williamsmolinskijr.com/api/' + route, params={"Code": "IWantToKnowMore"})

#Handles creating the output file
def output(content, fileName):
    outputFileName = fileName
    outputFile = open(outputFileName, "w+")
    outputFile.write(content)
    outputFile.close()

#Determines if the request was successful or not
def valid_response(response):
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return True
    else:
        return False

if __name__ == '__main__':
    #Sends the initial request to the api for the options menu which will display all of the files available to be requested
    response = send_request("options")
    
    if valid_response(response):
        #The response was valid and the program now asks for which file the user wants to receive
        print("Enter e to exit")
        option = input(response.text)
        
        #Loops until e is entered which will stop the program
        while option != 'e':
            
            #Sends a request to the api for the file that the user requested
            response = send_request("options/" + option)
                
            if valid_response(response):
                #The request was a success and a file will be created with the contents of the file on the users device
                output(response.text, "WilliamSmolinskiJr" + option)
                print("SUCCESS\n")
            else:
                print(response)
                print("FAILURE, Did you type the name wrong?\n")
            
            option = input("Would you like another? (e to exit):")
    else:
        print(response)
